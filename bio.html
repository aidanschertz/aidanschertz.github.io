	Hi, I'm Aidan. I grew up in Milwaukee, WI. I have four older sisters, a twin sister, two dogs and a cat. Since my dad is a pilot, it was only natural that we name all of our pets after cities. We were taught to be adventurous at a young age, and in first grade I declared that I wanted to be a pilot when I grew up. A few things that fascinates me about airplanes are the complexity of the cockpit and the cognitive workload pilots face while flying. After learning about the field of Human Factors, I was immediately drawn to it. <br/>I am currently a junior at Tufts University studying Human Factors Enginnering. Here at Tufts, I am involved in Food Rescue and STOMP, a program where I teach engineering curriculum in an elementary school every week. I am also in the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at the MIT unit. There, I learn skills and take classes that prepare me to comission as an officer after graduation. After commissioning, I hope to complete my childhood dream and train to fly for the Navy. In my free time I enjoy hiking, biking, poetry, and am an avid tea-drinker.</p>
